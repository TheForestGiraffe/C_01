# 42 Piscine — C_01: Pointers and Memory Functions

This repository contains my work for the **C_01 module** of the 42 Piscine curriculum.

**Note:** During the actual subject submission at 42, the exercises were organized in separate `ex00`, `ex01`, ..., `ex08` folders as required by the subject.
In this public repo the files are placed at the top level for better visibility and transparency of my work.

## Module Overview

The **C_01** module introduces you to pointers, memory access, and basic reference manipulation. You implement small functions that exercise these concepts in increasing complexity.

Exercises include:

| Exercise | Function / Task |
|----------|------------------|
| `ex00`   | `ft_ft` — Set an integer value via pointer |
| `ex01`   | `ft_ultimate_ft` — Manipulate value through multiple levels of pointers |
| `ex02`   | `ft_swap` — Swap two integers using pointers |
| `ex03`   | `ft_div_mod` — Divide two ints storing quotient & remainder via pointers |
| `ex04`   | `ft_ultimate_div_mod` — Advanced div/mod using pointer indirection |
| `ex05`   | `ft_putstr` — Write a string to standard output |
| `ex06`   | `ft_strlen` — Count characters in a string |
| `ex07`   | `ft_rev_int_tab` — Reverse an integer array |
| `ex08`   | `ft_sort_int_tab` — Sort an integer array in ascending order |

## Skills & Concepts

Throughout this module you practice:

- Basic pointer usage and dereferencing  
- Pointer to pointer patterns  
- Manipulating values *by reference*  
- Simple array handling  
- Writing functions to match strict prototypes  

This builds essential understanding of memory and references in C, which is fundamental for all higher-level C work.

## Submission & Evaluation

At 42, each exercise:

- Was submitted to the **Moulinette** for automated testing  
- Had to follow filename and function prototype requirements  
- Required passing `norminette` checks (coding style enforcement)  

During peer evaluation, you also needed to explain your code to a reviewer.
